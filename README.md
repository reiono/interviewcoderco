### License:
if you give a shit about a licenses, you are not the kind of person to use this service xD
#### Why use this instead?
Closed source software is analagous to malware, why would you trust lee's code?

Why not use their service:
-  the developers are cocky dumbasses that think they're smart.
 - they tried dominate news cycle, only getting 15 minutes of fame.
 - it is expensive
 - leetcode isn't *that* hard, if lee can hit the top 2%, anyone should be able to hit top 1% in <100h
 - Koreans and Indians are cancer to society.

Hi mom!
